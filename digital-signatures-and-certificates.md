Explanation:
Digital signatures prove who sent data and that it wasn’t changed.
They use hashing + encryption together.

How it works:

1. Data is hashed → creates a unique fingerprint.


2. Sender encrypts the hash with their private key → digital signature.


3. Receiver decrypts it with the sender’s public key → verifies authenticity.



Real Example:
When downloading software (e.g., Microsoft Installer), Windows checks its digital signature to ensure it’s not tampered with.
